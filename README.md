## Sightlines

Sightlines is a system for using a [Novation Launchpad] as an information
display and control panel for general computing tasks. This is a personal
project, so the capabilities provided are specific to the author's requirements.
However, you may find something useful here that is worth reusing in your own
project.

Most of the hard work is done by the [`launchpad.py`] library, written by
@FMMT666.
